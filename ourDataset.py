  Other than your family, there are most definitely at least a handful of friends who really cherish you.\
  Yo just thought of a couple of names didn't you? Call them up and just talk like how you normally would.\
  If you couldn't come up with the names for some reason, call your mother; and tell her you love her.\
  Now even if that is not the best solution, promise to yourself that even if there is no one else in this\
  world for you, you yourself will ALWAYS be there for you.. and if you could make it this far without anyone,\
  you sure can make it a lot further. Lots of love. :)",
